## System Overview

The LLM Cursor Control System is an innovative solution designed to add human-like text manipulation capabilities to Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional LLMs, when processing long texts or performing editing operations, must memorize the entire content and regenerate it without errors, which is both inefficient and resource-intensive. This system adds a specialized "cursor control head" component that enables LLMs to perform cursor-based operations such as select, copy, and paste, similar to how humans interact with text, significantly improving text processing efficiency.

The system is based on a reinforcement learning framework, using GPT-2 as the base model and training a specialized neural network component to control the cursor in a text editing environment. The system supports various text editing tasks, including copy-paste, find-replace, and cursor navigation, providing LLMs with human-like interface interaction capabilities.

## System Architecture

The system uses a modular design, mainly consisting of the following parts:

1. **Base Model Layer**: Uses GPT-2 model for text processing, providing text generation and representation capabilities
2. **Control Layer**: Cursor control agent, based on reinforcement learning, responsible for action selection
3. **Environment Layer**: Text editing environment, simulating a cursor operation interface
4. **Evaluation Layer**: Task generator and reward system, providing training signals

## Core Components

### Text Editing Environment

The Text Editing Environment (`TextEditingEnv`) is an environment based on the OpenAI Gym interface that simulates a simplified text editor, supporting the following functions:

- Cursor movement (up, down, left, right)
- Text selection (using Shift key with direction keys)
- Copy, paste, cut operations
- Special key state tracking (Ctrl, Shift, Alt)

#### Observation Space

The environment's observation space includes the following information:
- Current text content
- Cursor position (row, column)
- Selected region (if any)
- Clipboard content
- Key states

#### Action Space

The environment supports 12 basic actions:
- 0-3: Cursor movement (up, down, left, right)
- 4-6: Special keys (Ctrl, Shift, Alt)
- 7-8: Mouse clicks (left button, right button)
- 9-11: Editing operations (copy, paste, cut)

#### Visualization

The environment provides a Pygame-based visualization interface for intuitive display of cursor position, text content, and selected regions, facilitating debugging and demonstration.

### Task Generator and Reward System

The Task Generator (`TaskGenerator`) is responsible for creating text editing tasks and defining appropriate reward functions for each task. The system currently supports three main task types:

#### Copy-Paste Task

Requires the agent to copy a specific segment from the text and paste it to a designated location.

**Reward Design**:
- Cursor moves to the starting position of the copy area: +0.1
- Correctly selects text: +0.1 * (proportion selected)
- Successful copy operation: +1.0
- Cursor moves to paste position: +0.1
- Successful paste operation: +1.0 * (improvement in similarity to target)
- Task completion: +10.0
- Small penalty per step: -0.01

#### Find-Replace Task

Requires the agent to find all specific words in the text and replace them with another word.

**Reward Design**:
- Replacement progress reward: +2.0 * (proportion replaced)
- Task completion: +10.0
- Small penalty per step: -0.01

#### Cursor Navigation Task

Requires the agent to move the cursor to a specific position in the text.

**Reward Design**:
- Distance reward: +1.0 / (1.0 + distance to target)
- Moving in the correct direction: +0.1
- Reaching the target position: +5.0
- Small penalty per step: -0.01

### Cursor Control Agent

The Cursor Control Agent (`PPOAgent`) is a reinforcement learning agent based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, responsible for learning how to perform operations in the text editing environment. The agent consists of the following main components:

#### Text Encoder

The `TextEncoder` class uses the GPT-2 model to convert text into high-dimensional embedding representations.

#### Cursor Control Head

`CursorControlHead` is a neural network model that receives text representations and environment states as input and outputs action probability distributions:

```
Input Layer:
  - Text embedding (GPT-2 output, 768 dimensions)
  - Cursor position (2 dimensions)
  - Selection area (2 dimensions)
  - Clipboard content (GPT-2 output, 768 dimensions)
  - Key states (3 dimensions)

Hidden Layers:
  - Multi-head self-attention mechanism
  - Fully connected layers
  
Output Layer:
  - Action probability distribution (12 dimensions)
  - State value estimate (1 dimension)
```

#### PPO Training Algorithm

The agent uses the PPO algorithm for training, with the main steps including:

1. Collecting experience trajectories
2. Calculating discounted returns and advantage estimates
3. Multiple epochs of policy updates using a clipped objective function
4. Value function updates and entropy regularization

### LLM Integration

The `LLMWithCursorControl` class integrates the GPT-2 language model with the cursor control agent, providing a unified interface.

This class provides the following main functions:
- Using GPT-2 to generate text
- Using the cursor control agent to perform editing tasks
- Interactive sessions combining text generation and editing operations
